        <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
        <p>
            I admire Zinedine Zidane for his calm leadership, discipline, and ability to succeed
            both as a player and as a coach. His journey teaches the value of focus, humility,
            and excellence under pressure. He is not only a winner on the field but also a devoted
            family person and a truly humble player. A legend respected across generations,
            he represents greatness without hatred, earning admiration through character
            as much as through achievement.
